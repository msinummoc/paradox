here are some mods made or modified by me to improve gaming, please put them as the order given below:
+ selfmade: mainly change static_modifier.txt and define.lua and integrate some of xorme_ai mod.
+ development expanded lite: to automatically increase or decrease development. modified to fit selfmade mod.
+ chinese culture assimilation: use dip to change the culture in central asia, korea/japan and south-east asia to make it in chinese culture group. also allow colony to spread their culture and russia to colonize the steppe.
+ 简简单单中国细化: increase the amounts of province of china and make Ming have more than 2000 devs when game begins. I modify some province by the way(in selfmade, so should be used together)
+ new world colony names fan fork cn ver: origin from workshop. add some dynamic names to different countries.
+ chinese language mod for 1.36
+ chinese language supplementary mod for 1.36: this mod should be replaced by what has been modified by me because it will overlap some history file in the selfmade and make things bad
+ automatic operation: from workshop to make build buildings a much easier task.
